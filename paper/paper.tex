\section{Introduction}

Author diarization is the problem of segmenting text within a document into classes each corresponding to an author, i.e. assignment of each part of a text to an author. The analyzed document can be a result of collaborative work or plagiarism by a single author. The problem is in more detail described here. The problem can be divided into 3 subproblems:
% reference
% authorship analysis, 
% intrinsic plagiarism detection, author diarization
% PAN 2016 author diarization task
% dataset

\section{The proposed approaches}
clustering, sliding window
pipeline: preprocessing (tokenization) -> basic features -> transformed features (including scaling) -> clustering

clustering metric

\begin{itemize}
\item a
\item b
\end{itemize}

features

differences: fixed features + transformation vs document-dependent features
