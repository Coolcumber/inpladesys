Naraku's detatchments are: Kanna - the first detachment of Naraku.

Once a soul is trapped within her mirror, Kanna can controltheir host bodies to carry out her bidding. The mirror also has theability to create a glass demon that can copy the abilities ofwhatever it reflects, though Kanna receives all damage in the glassdemon's stead . In her last battle, Kannais ordered by Naraku to commit suicide, shattering herself and theglass demon she was currently using into thousands of tiny shards.One of the shards hits Kagome's right eye, and Kanna directs herfinal thought to tell Kagome how to destroy Naraku. Kagura hatesher creator and wishes to be free from him. After Kagura helpsKohaku escape from Naraku, Naraku mockingly returns her heartbefore fatally attacking her and leaving her to die.
Kagura - his second detachment. A wind sorceress, Kaguraprimarily uses a wind-manipulating fan to enhance her powers andcreate wind-based attacks, including a blade-like tornado attackand using wind to animate dead bodies. She can also use a pair offeathers that she wears in her hair for transportation, enlargingthem then using them to ride in the wind.
Goshinki - Naraku'sthird detachment takes the form of a large horned purple demon.Goshinki has the ability to read the thoughts of others, whichenables him to outmaneuver InuYasha. Goshinki breaks the Tetsusaigaby biting it, however, this ultimately results in his death at theclaws of InuYasha.
Kage romaru - the fou rthdetachment, is a tiny slithering creature with a human head and twoscythed-arms. Despite his form, Kager maru is quite fast, and canalso tunnel in the ground. He resides in Juromaru's stomach, who isloyal only to him, where he can make surprise attacks on theenemy.
Juromaru - the fifthincarnation is perhaps the least loyal of all of the incarnationNaraku creates. Juromaru's only loyalty is his elder brotherKageromaru, who is hidden in Juromaru's stomach when covered by ametal mask. Juromaru has little intelligence and never speaks,characterized only by a lust to kill. He and his elder brother werekilled by InuYasha and Koga.
Muso - the sixth detachment of Naraku was separated from Naraku in his attempt toremove his human side, Onigumo, which would also remove Onigumo'slove for Kikyo. Naraku cared so little for the incarnation heneither named it or gave it a face. Muso took both his name andface from a wandering monk he slew. Naraku quickly realizes,however, that he cannot abandon Onigumo so easily, and Muso wasabsorbed back into Naraku.
The Infant -Naraku's heart and seventh detachment is capable of speakingfluently. He is a baby that can possess anyone with the darkness intheir heart. His main goal is to control Kagome's mind by findingthe pain, anger, or jealousy within her heart, and use herabilities to find the remaining shards of the Shikon Jewel. TheInfant is not loyal to Naraku and is destroyed along with Moryomaruby Naraku.
Hakudoshi - theeighth detachment from Naraku is created from The Infant's body, hewas Entei's final master and takes the form of a young child. LikeNaraku, his heart is not inside his body, so he is able toendlessly regenerate himself. Over time,both The Infant and Hakudoshi grow tired of Naraku's rule overthem, and seek to betray and overthrow him. Naraku eventuallyrealized their wish, however, and instructs his Saimyosho toabandon Hakudoshi in battle, giving him no protection againstMiroku's Wind Tunnel, and he is destroyed.
Byakuya - Naraku'sninth and final detachment is meant to replace Kagura. He is loyalto Naraku and has an incredible power of creating illusions.Byakuya has the power to possess people with paper soldiers, summonvines to entrap his enemies, teleport others to differentdimensions, detach organs from his body, and erectb arriers. He travels on a giant origamipaper crane. When InuYasha attacks him with his Meidou Zangetsuha,Byakuya is absorbed into it.
The other members of Naraku's groupare: Kohaku Kohaku is Sango's younger brother, who wasonce under the control of Naraku. Naraku forced Kohaku to turnagainst his companions, killing his fat herand all the demon slayers. Sango survived solely by sheer luck.Castle guards killed Kohaku that night, only to have him laterresurrected by Naraku as an amnesiac puppet. After severalencounters with Sango and her friends, he began to recover hispainful memories and sought to secretly find a way to destroyNaraku while still maintaining the illusion of being under hiscontrol; he later formed an alliance with Kagura, who soughtfreedom from Naraku's tyranny.
Following Kagura's death, he joins Kikyo ashe believes travelling with her is the only way to redeem himself.He remains by her side until she tells him to separate from her forfear of being unable to keep his shard pure. However, he is nearlycaptured by Byakuya, and only a timely arrival bySesshomaru saveshim. Kohaku remains with Sesshomaru's group after this, and helpsprotect Rin, who he has a friendship with. In the last chapter ofthe manga, Kohaku goes with Kirara along with a new weapon whichTotosai made for him.

Moryomaru Moryomaru was an enemy of Naraku. He was a100-foot long monster in a human form who could shoot blasts ofenergy from his arm. At first, he is merely a life force puppet,and as such, he had no true personality, soul or will. He is givento Kanna, who places The Infant inside of him, giving MoryomaruNaraku's physical life force. Moryomaru begins to increase more andmore in power as he absorbs different demons to gain theirabilities.
During a battle, he nearly defeats anonslaught of most of Naraku's enemies which included Kikyo, Kohaku,Kagome, InuYasha, Miroku, Sango, Shippo, and Sesshomaru. Hesucceeds in breaking Sesshomaru's sword, but flees after nearlylosing a shard of the Shikon Jewel.

Her mother,Queen Tekkei, became ill after she ate a poisoned y kai, whichprompted Princess Abi to collect blood for her. After attackingseveral villages, Naraku appeared to make a deal with her; he wouldgive her weapons and she would become his servant in exchange forhis blood.
Princess Abi eventually attempts to fightwith InuYasha, though the battle ends with him leaving her afterdestroying her shield. Princess Abi grew suspicious of Naraku overtime and decides to betray him. To proveshe isn't an ally, she attempts to attack The Infant, one ofNaraku's offspring.
After a quick battle with InuYasha, PrincessAbi leaves, finally having enough blood for her mother.

Sesshomaru's role inthe series has varied from antagonist, to hero, and most often ananti-hero, depending on his current situation, but he isconsistently shown as InuYasha's rival and the two have fought manytimes. Their rivalry runs deep, influenced primarily bySesshomaru's hatred for half-breeds (which InuYasha is) and hisblaming InuYasha for the death of their father. He also hatesInuYasha for possessing their father's legendary sword Tetsusaiga,which he believes is rightfully his.

Initially portrayed as a cold, stoic characterwith a hatred of humans, Sesshomaru undergoes a series of trialsthroughout the series that reshape his beliefs and hisrelationships with those around him. These trials include his carefor an orphan named Rin, and his possession of his father's secondsword Tenseiga, which can revive the dead.
