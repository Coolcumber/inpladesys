and is different from other hotels in the area.The guests are discerning and low key, who want to be near the Las Vegas Strip but would rather spend their nights in a peaceful, calmer hotel. The Ritz-Carlton prides itself on it's customer service, the service feels posh and deluxe, but not over the top or pretentious. You will feel equally at ease in the hotel whether you prefer to wear jeans or a suit, and the hotel is well known for offering a warm welcome to gay couples.
The hotel was designed by the architects Wimberly, Allison, Tong & Goo who followed instructions to design a Tuscan Italian-Mediterranean style resort. The three-storey 375ft span bridge structure emulates Italy's Pontevecchio and spans a secluded lake and is home to Club Level guestrooms, function areas and retail space.

The hotel is U-shape which provides guests with fabulous panoramic views of the lake and mountains. Attached to the hotel is a adjacent casino, and the two-storey spa contains treatment rooms arranged in pavilions, surrounding an interior Italian garden courtyard. A conference centre overlooks the retail village and formal Italian gardens and lake.

The construction of the Lake Las Vegas was carried out by Perini Building. The primary challenge was the construction of the Pontevecchio Bridge over Lake Las Vegas. There are four bridge abutments with 16 driven piles per abutment.

The most difficult portion of this phase was driving piles adjacent to the two underground by-pass pipelines, which carry the Las Vegas wash overflow under Lake Las Vegas and directly into Lake Mead.

The danger of collapse or damage to the pipelines due to the close proximity of the pile-driving operation required extra caution, as well as added insurance liability. Once the piles were driven, and the pile caps and abutment walls were poured and in place, barges were brought in to erect structural steel and metal decking.

Another challenge faced was meeting the Ritz-Carlton's standard limiting visibility of electrical and mechanical trim. This required detailed coordination between the interior designer and each subcontractor to determine exact placement of electrical receptacles, air supply and return, and access panels.
The spa is situated on two levels, with a relaxing garden, a cafe serving healthy food and light snacks and access to a stately pool area Treatments include the Mesquite Tree Coccon body polish, which is very popular, and the Gentleman's Fitness Facial is a great for the dry Las Vegas air.
