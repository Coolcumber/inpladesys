Market and sales

The Titan is not intended to challenge the big 3 "Detroit Trucks" in sales numbers, but rather is meant to be an alternative to them and provide Nissan with some in-roads into the highly competitive truck market.

Consumers in the southcentral part of the United States, which includes Texas, account for nearly 25% of Titans sales in the United States.

Models and equipment

The Titan features a 32 valve 5.6 L VK56DE V8 engine which generates 305 hp (227 kW ) at 4900 rpm and 379 ft lbf (514 N m) of torque at 3600 rpm. The 2007 model has been upgraded to 317 hp and 385 ft lbf (522 N m) of torque. It is available in either rear wheel drive or four wheel drive with a 5-speed automatic transmission. It comes with a choice of a Crew Cab with a 5'7" (1.7 m) bed or King (extended) Cab with a 6'7" (2.0 m) bed. Some people have criticized the truck for not offering a regular cab. The 2008 Titan lineup has an optional 7-foot (2.1 m) long bed to the Crew Cab and an optional 8-foot (2.4 m) long bed to the King Cab. It also with the long bed will come with a larger 37-gallon (US) (140 L) fuel tank. The already available 5-speed transmission and 5.6L V8 will remain standard equipment on all Nissan Titans.

Reception

Upon its release, the Titan was praised for its combination of a roomy interior, strong towing capacity, aggressive styling, and innovative features, such as wide opening rear doors in the King Cab, factory sprayed-on bedliner, and a lockable storage compartment outside the bed on the driver's side. It was listed by Edmunds.com as the best full-size truck. The Titan was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2004.

Criticism

The Titan has drawn criticism for its limited body styles. In contrast to other full-sized pickups, the vehicle does not offer a Regular Cab, and is only available with the King Cab and Crew Cab models. The Titan is only available with the 5.6L V8, and does not have a V6 engine option.

Safety

The Titan has a 5-star rating from the NHTSA for driver frontal crash, and a 4-star rating for passenger frontal crash. Head Injury Criterion Driver: 488 Passenger: 579 Chest Deceleration (Gs) Driver: 43 Passenger: 42 Femur Load l/r1 (lb) Driver: 723/532 Passenger: 495/212

Nissan Titan - What the Auto Press Says

The Titan has outstanding engine power and adaptable hauling capacity, but can't match the interior quality of class leaders.

With a high level of practicality and strong powertrain, most reviewers say the 2008 Nissan Titan is a strong contender in the full-size truck market, with some even going so far as to call it a threat to the American-made trucks that lead the class. MarketWatch calls the Titan "a very serious challenge in a part of the market that the U.S. has had to itself since Davy Crockett wondered if there might be a better way to travel to the Alamo." Meanwhile, Automobile Magazine's writer jokes, "Attention, Motor City: Godzilla has risen, and he's tramping your way."

However, after more than three years on the market, the Titan still hasn't pulled in a lot of American buyers. As gas prices get even higher, the Titan's dismal fuel economy, even for a large truck, isn't likely to win it any new fans. New for 2008, the Nissan Titan adds an off-roading trim, the PRO-4X, to a lineup that includes the XE, SE and LE. But many still report the truck does not have the right ingredients to sway truck drivers that are loyal to American brands. If you're shopping for a full-size pickup, the Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra are examples of American trucks that fare well with reviewers and drivers.
