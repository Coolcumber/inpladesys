California State income Tax is the main income for the government. It is very important for all citizens to pay their income tax properly because the money generated through income tax is spent for their citizens only. Different countries follow different systems in collecting income tax from their citizens but in the United States of America, California State is one of the important commercial states. This is one of the best income tax revenue providing states for the United States of America. The Franchise Tax Board is governed by three members committee. Tax payers of the California state are electing two of the three members of the board, and the third member is appointed by the government.


The California state income tax system is difficult to understand, but profitable. To understand the income tax calculation, a sample of the method of income tax calculation is provided. In fact, the government expects all of its citizens to pay the income tax, which means that they must earn that much to protect their family as well as the government. All the persons, who are earning more than seven thousand five hundred and fifty dollars, should pay the income tax. It is very easy for the regular salaried persons to pay their income tax through their offices and companies. Generally, these organizations collect the income tax from all the taxpayers and pay them directly to the Franchise Tax Board.

In the California state income tax paying system, there are six stages in the percentage of income tax from ten to thirty five percent
Ten percent of the income tax for one to seven thousand five hundred and fifty dollars.
Fifteen percent income tax is collected for the amount from seven thousand five hundred and fifty one dollars to thirty thousand and six hundred and fifty dollars.
For income above thirty thousand six hundred and fifty to seventy four thousand two hundred dollars, twenty percent of income tax should be paid. From seventy four thousand and two hundred and one to hundred and fifty four thousand eight hundred dollars, the income tax is fixed as twenty eight percent.
Thirty three percent of income tax has to be paid for the income from hundred and fifty four thousand eight hundred and one to three hundred and thirty six thousand five hundred and fifty dollars.
For the income above three hundred and thirty six thousand six hundred and fifty five dollars, thirty five percent of income tax is collected.
This income tax procedure is applicable for the individuals. When a person is filling his income tax return jointly with his spouse, they may get some additional concessions in the income tax payment. Different slabs are fixed for the widow or widower and head of household.





e-pay MANDATORY FOR INDIVIDUALS Mandatory e-pay Law

Governor Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Bill 1389 on September 30, 2008, adding Section 19011.5 to the California Revenue and Taxation Code. This new law requires individuals to remit all future payments electronically once they: Make an estimated tax or extension payment (by check or electronic method) over $20,000 for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2009; or
File an original return with a tax liability over $80,000 for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2009.

Regardless of the amount owed, fiduciaries, estates, and trusts are not required to make payments electronically.


Unlike corporations, there is no registration process for individuals subject to the mandatory e-pay law. Electronic Payment Methods

Who Qualifies for Free State Tax Return Filing through CalFile

California taxpayers may use CalFile whether they do not owe taxes, owe a payment, or are due a refund.
There are some exceptions, but generally speaking, anyone who lived in California the entire year, is filing an original return (i.e. not amended), and whose only other reportable tax is Use Tax, may qualify to use CalFile.

The state has set qualification criteria, which is listed on the Franchise Tax Board website. In general, those eligible for CalFile must claim five or fewer dependents and have federal adjusted gross income (AGI) below $155,416 per individual filer. (This limit is $233,129 for head of household and $310,837 for married/registered domestic partnership, filing jointly and qualifying widowers).

Who Cannot Use CalFile
The FTB website lists several exceptions that prohibit an individual from using the free filing program. Among taxpayers who may not qualify are those with unique situations such as
Roth IRA conversions, individuals claiming a disaster loss or military-related extension, and those who need to make certain state adjustments to federal itemized deductions. Taxpayers must use original, not substituted or corrected W-2s.


Tips for Using CalFile
Thoroughly review the qualification criteria and exceptions. There are many exceptions to qualification; fortunately, there are other free state filing programs available to those who do not qualify to use CalFile. Know what last name was used on the most recently filed return because the CalFile system looks up taxpayer information by searching for a last name as it appeared on a 2006 tax return. A taxpayer whose name changed since filing a 2006 tax return must access the system using their old name, then update their last name within CalFile upon log in.
The CalFile program allows a maximum of twenty minutes per webpage, so individuals may not be able to walk away and finish later. Set aside enough time to complete the return in one sitting. Fortunately, the California Franchise Tax Board claims that individuals with straightforward returns should be able to complete their returns in approximately 15 minutes, assuming they have all tax information on hand. Taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes under certain thresholds may qualify for free federal tax return e-filing as well.
