# Inpladesys - Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection System

This repository is going to contain an implementation and a description paper for an author diarization (and intrinsic plagiarism detection) system as a result of a student project which is a part of [*Text Analysis and Retrieval*](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar) (*TAR*) coursework.

## Author Diarization and Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection
Author diarization is the problem of segmenting text within a document into classes each corresponding to an author, i.e. assignment of every part of a text to an author. The analyzed document can be a result of collaborative work or plagiarism by a single author. The problem is in more detail described [here](http://pan.webis.de/clef16/pan16-web/author-identification). The problem can be divided into 3 subproblems:
* **Traditional intrinsic plagiarism detection.** It is assumed that at least 70% of the text is written by a single author and the rest by other authors. The task is to segment the text into 2 classes.
* **Diarization with a given number of authors.** The task is to segment the text into *n* classes, each representing an author.
* **Diarization with an unknown number of authors.** The task is to segment the text into *n* classes, with the number of authors *n* not being known in advance.

## The Assignment ([source](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/TAR-2017-ProjectTopics.pdf))
Intrinsic plagiarism detection (also called author diarization) attempts to detect plagiarized text fragments within a single document (in contrast with standard plagiarism detection across documents). Given a document, the task is to identify and group text fragments that were written by different authors. To make things a bit harder, the author change may occur at any position in the text, and not only at sentence or paragraph boundaries. The task is split into three subtasks of increasing difficulty, based on the number of (known) authors. First subtasks assumes two, second a fixed number, and third an unknown number of authors.

### Model components
#### Basic features
* *bf1* - a small selection of simple lexical features **TODO**
#### Feature space transformation
* *normalized* - translated to 0-mean and scaled to unit variance for each feature
* *fp1* - described [here](http://mathb.in/134812)
* *fp2* - feature space linearly transformed to adapt class shapes for k-means clustering - contrained minimization problem described [here](http://mathb.in/135013)
* *average covariance matrix inverse* - feature space linearly transformed to adapt class shapes for k-means clustering - inverse of the average covariance martrix
* *neural network* - a fully connected neural network applied over normalized features
#### Clustering
* *k-means* 
### Models
#### Dummy baseline 1
* description: The whole document is predicted to have been written by a single author.
#### Dummy baseline 2
* description: A markov chain is used to generate a random segmentation. The static probabilities and expected segment lengths are computed based on the training set.
#### Abstract model A
* description: Firstly, all documents in the training set are segmented into toeken segments of length *n*. Each segment is labeled by the class that most words within it belong to. For each segment features are measured. A feature transformation is learned over all documents to adapt the feature space for clustering, whereafter the system is ready for author diarization. Author diarization for a document is performed by clustering in the transformed feature space.
