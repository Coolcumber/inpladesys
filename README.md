# inpladesys - Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection System

This repository is going to contain an implementation and a description paper for a plagiarism detection system as a result of a student project which is a part of *Text analisys and retrieval* (*TAR*) coursework.

## The assignment ([source](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/TAR-2017-ProjectTopics.pdf))
Intrinsic plagiarism detection (also called author diarization) attempts to detect plagiarized text fragments within a single document (in contrast with standard plagiarism detection across documents). Given a document, the task is to identify and group text fragments that were written by different authors. To make things a bit harder, the author change may occur at any position in the text, and not only at sentence or paragraph boundaries. The task is split into three subtasks of increasing difficulty, based on the number of (known) authors. First subtasks assumes two, second a fixed number, and third an unknown number of authors.
