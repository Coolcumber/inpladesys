Volvo Cars is a Swedish car manufacturer founded in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1927. Currently, the company is owned by Ford Motor Company.
The name Volvo is Latin, and literally means "I roll" (in a more modern sense, "I drive"). It was chosen because it was considered a good trademark for a ball bearing as well as for an automobile.
Volvo was originally formed as a subsidiary company to the ball bearing maker SKF. It was not until Volvo AB was introduced on the Swedish stock exchange, in 1935, that SKF sold most of the shares in the company. After that Volvo Cars was owned by Volvo AB until 1999, when it became part of the Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group.
Volvo produces cars ranging from SUVs, wagons, and sedans to compact executive sedans and coupes. However, the company's market share is shrinking in the North American market. New markets such as Russia, China and India are going strong, though, gaining in creased market share. In Russia, Volvo expected sales to double, exceeding 20,000 units by the end of 2007. This would make Russia one of the company's top ten markets. Already, Volvo can lay claim to the leading position in Russia's luxury car segment.
Older models were often compared to tractors, possibly because Volvo AB has always manufactured heavy equipment, first as Bolinder-Munktell, and later u nder the division Volvo Construction Equipment. Considered slow and heavy, the classic, block-shaped Volvo earned the endearment "brick", with the more powerful turbo charged variants known as "turbobricks". More recent models have moved away from the boxy styles of the 1970s and 1980s and built a reputation for sporting performance. But even before the newer, sporty styles were launch, the "turbobricks" had shown their excellence with the phenomenal success of factory-supported Volvo 240 turbos winning both the 1985 European Touring Car Championship and 1986 Australian Touring Car Championship.
Volvo's are built to last. Proud owners are often boast of prodigious mileages, with one well-documented 1966 Volvo P1800S having been driven over 2.6 million miles. According to some figures the average lifespan of a Volvo 19.8 years before it is discarded -- second only to Mercedes. The reliability of a Volvo is considered better than average, and in the USA Volvo dealers are listed by Forbes as the 9th best general car manufacturer, and 6th best for luxury cars.
A brief history of Volvo Volvo company was founded in Gothenburg, Sweden in the year 1927 as a subsidiary company wholly owned by SKF. Assar Gabrielsson was appointed as the first managing director and Gustav Larson was the technical manager.
The Volvo trademark was first registered by SKF the 11th of May, 1915. It was intended to be used for a special series of ball bearings for the American market, but while s ome pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name 'Volvo' were manufactured, they were never released to the market and so the trademark was never used. Instead, the SKF trademark as it looks today was used for all SKF-products.
It was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, this time as a trademark and company name for an car. The first Volvo car left the assembly line on the 14th of April, 1927, was called Volvo V4. After this the young company produced closed top and cabriolet vehicles, which were designed to hold strong in the Swedish climate and terrain. The Volvo symbol , a circle with an arrow pointing to the top right, is an ancient chemistry sign for iron and was designed to symbolize the strength of iron used in the car -- as Sweden is known for its quality iron. The diagonal strip of metal across the grille came about to hold the actual symbol in front of the radiator. In the registration application for Volvo logotype in 1927, they simply made a copy of the entire radiator for the V4, viewed from the front.
In 1964, Volvo opened its Torslanda plant in Sweden, which is still one of its largest production sites -- chiefly producing large cars and SUVs. Then in 1965, the Ghent, Belgium plant was opened -- producing chiefly small cars -- which is the company's second largest production site. Finally in 1989, the Uddevalla plant in Sweden was opened. This site is now jointly operated by Volvo Car Corporation and Pininfarina of Italy.
A collection of Volvo's most important historical vehicles are now housed t he Volvo Museum, which moved to a permanent location in Arendal at Hisingen on May 30, 1995 after being housed for several years at "The Blue Hangar," at the then closed Torslanda Airport.
Acquisitions In the early 1970s, Volvo acquired the passenger car division of the Dutch company DAF, and marketed their small cars as Volvos before releasing the Dutch-built Volvo 340. The Volvo 340 went on to become one of the biggest-selling cars in the UK market in the 1980s.
Volvo Group, as one of the largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles in the world, took the initiative to sell its automobile manufacturing in 1998, in order to focus its efforts on the market for commercial vehicles. Ford saw advantages in acquiring a profitable prestige mid-size European automobile manufacturer, well renowned for its safety aspects, as an addition to its Premier Automotive Group. The buyout of Volvo Cars was announced on January 28, 1998, and in the following year the acquisition was completed at a price of $6.45 billion USD.
As a result of the divestiture, the Volvo trademark is now used by two separate companies: Volvo Group - a manufacturer of commercial vehicles, trucks, buses, industrial equipment and more, owned by Swedish interests. Volvo Cars - a manufacturer of automobiles owned by Ford Motor Company, in its Premier Automotive Group (PAG).
Corporate history within Ford Volvo Car Corporation is now part of Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group (PAG) and is the only brand left in the group since the sale of Jaguar, Aston Martin and Land Rover. Since its acquisition into the PAG, the company has expanded its range of vehicles.
After the sale of JLR to Tata of India, Ford decided to keep Volvo Cars despite mounting losses and gross economic down turns. Ford decided to restructure plans for Volvo Cars, pushing it further upmarket alongside the lower end of Mercedes and BMW sedans, wagons, and SUV crossovers. This turnaround was quite evident with the luxurious second generation Volvo S80 and the new small premium crossover Volvo XC60.
In around 2009, there were talks about what to do with Volvo Cars in the event of a market failure with US automakers that would include parent FOMOCO. Swedish interests mounted their concerns after repeated mass layoffs at Volvo, expressing that Sweden needs to enter the spotlight to help its automotive industry. The government was asked to look into a possible state ownership of Volvo, or financing both Volvo Cars and SAAB which was owned by GM.
Eventually Volvo responded to heated talks and decided that they did not want to see Volvo Cars fail, so they agreed to help Volvo cut costs through partnerships and even a possible share ownership within a larger consortium. Volvo repeated and stood firm that they would not buy back Volvo cars nor be sole majority owner. They were only willing to become part share owner of the car unit they once owned.
In December 2008, FOMOCO announced that it was considering a sale of the Volvo Cars unit through complex evaluations, but that it would try to make Volvo a more stand alone company.
VCNA management is often criticized for canceling the Free Maintenance program it used to offer on its new Automobiles back in 2006, Volvo relaunched the same program in 2009 to gain some market share and compete with BMW. The sales loss from 2006 to 2009 due to the previous cancellation is estimated to be 5000 new cars per year.
Competitions and sponsorship Volvo entered the European Touring Car Championship with the Volvo 240 in the mid-80s. The cars also entered the Guia Race -- part of the Macau Grand Prix -- in 1985, 1986 and 1987, and won in both 1985 and 1986.
Volvo also entered the British Touring Car Championship in the 90s with Tom Walkinshaw Racing. This partnership was responsible for the controversial 850 Estate racing car, which was only rendered uncompetitive when the FIA allowed the use of aerodynamic aids in 1995. TWR then built and ran the 850 Saloon, with six wins in 1995 and five wins in 1996, and one win for the S40 in 1997 in the BTCC. In 1998, TWR Volvo won the British Touring Car Championship with Rickard Rydell driving the S40R.
In 2008, Volvo entered the Swedish Touring Car Championship with a bioethanol E85 fuel powered C30. Robert Dahlgreen and Tommy Rustad drove, and finished 5th and 10th respectively in the championship.
The Volvo trademark is now jointly owned (50/50) by Volvo Group and Volvo Car Corporation and, surprisingly, one of the main promotional activities for the brand is the sailing race, the Volvo Ocean Race , the world s leading round-the-world yacht race , (formerly known as the Whitbread Around the World Race). There is also a Volvo Baltic Race and Volvo Pacific Race. Volvo has also had a long-standing commitment to the ISAF and is involved in the Volvo/ISAF World Youth Sailing Championships since 1997.
In addition, Volvo also sponsors golf tournaments all over the world, including major championship events called the Volvo Masters and Volvo China Open.
Volvo first sponsored the Volvo Ocean Race in 2001/2002. The current race has just finished with competitors taking to the sea at Allicante on the 29th of October, 2011, and the Groupama Sailing Team achieving overall victory in Galway, Ireland on the 5th of July 2012.
Volvo' s reputation for Safety
"Cars are driven by people. The guiding principle behind everything we make at Volvo, therefore, is and must remain, safety" -- Assar Gabrielsson and Gustav Larson, 1927.
Volvo cars have always evoked a reputation for solidity and reliability with a long list of innovations and safety features.
In 1944, laminated glass was introduced in the PV model. In 1958, Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin invented and patented the modern 3-Point Safety Belt, which became standard on all Volvo cars in 1959. Volvo was the first company to produce cars with padded dashboards starting in late 1956 with their Amazon model. Additionally, Volvo developed the first rear-facing child seat in 1964 and introduced its own booster seat in 1978.
In 1986, Volvo introduced the first central high-mounted stoplight (a brake light not shared with the rear tail lights), which became federally mandated in the United States in the 1986 model year. Seat belt and child seat innovation continued as shown in the 1991 model 960, which introduced the first three-point seat belt for the middle of the rear seat and a child safety cushion integrated in the middle armrest. Also in 1991 came the introduction of the Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) on the 940/960 and 850 models, which channeled the force of a side impact away from the doors and into the safety cage.
To add to its SIPS in 1995, Volvo was the first to introduce side airbags, and installed them as standard equipment in all models in 1995. In 1998, Volvo also developed and was the first to install a head protecting airbag, which was made standard in all new models as well as some existing models. The head-protecting airbag was not available on the 1996 C70 due to the initial design deploying the airbag from the roof; the C70, being a convertible, could not accommodate such an airbag. Later years of the C70 featured a head-protecting airbag deploying upwards from the door, negating the issue of roof position. It has been stated by many testing authorities that side head protecting curtain airbags can reduce risk of death in a side impact by up to 40% and brain injury by up to 55%, as well as protecting in a rollover situation.
In 1998, Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), a safety device to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions. In 2004, Volvo introduced the BLIS system, which detects vehicles entering the Volvo's blind spot with a side view mirror mounted sensor and alerts the driver with a light. That year also saw Volvos sold in all markets equipped with side-marker lights and daytime-running lights (the latter having already been available in many markets for some time). Much of Volvo's safety technology now also goes into other Ford vehicles. In 2005, Volvo presented the second generation of Volvo C70, it comes with extra stiff door-mounted inflatable side curtains (the first of its kind in a convertible).
In 2006, Volvo's Personal Car Communicator (PCC) remote control was launched as an optional feature with the all new Volvo S80. This feature enables a driver to review the security level, know whether they have set the alarm, and detect if the car is locked before the driver gets to their car. Additionally, a heartbeat sensor warns if someone is hiding inside the car. The heartbeat sensor is rumored to also work with the SOS feature of Volvo's new telematics system. The all new Volvo S80 is also the first Volvo model to feature Adaptive cruise control (ACC) with Collision Warning and Brake Support (CWBS).
By the mid-1990s there was little to distinguish Volvo from some other manufacturers (notably Renault) on safety when put through standardized tests such as Euro NCAP. A 2005 FOLKSAM report puts the 740/940 (from 1982 on) in the 15% better than average category, the second from the top category. Also, the production of P1800 had to be stopped because it did not fulfill US safety standards. The Volvo 745 was also recalled due to that the front seatbelts mounts could break in a collision.
Since 2004, all Volvo models except for the C70 and C30 are available with an all wheel drive system developed by Haldex Traction of Sweden.
Even though Volvo Car Corp is owned by the Ford Motor Company, the safety systems of Volvo are still made standard on all of their vehicles. Volvo has patented all of their safety innovations including SIPS, WHIPS, ROPS, DSTC, IC, and body structures. Some of these systems have shown up in other Ford vehicles in related forms only because Volvo has licenced the FOMOCO and other PAG members to use these features.
Safety reputation under question? According to Russ Rader, a spokesman for the American non-profit, non-governmental Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Volvo is lagging behind its competitors. Dan Johnston, a Volvo spokesman, denied that the company's vehicles are any less safe than the Institute's top-rated vehicles, adding that, "it's just a philosophy on safety that is different from building cars to pass these kinds of tests".
Even so, Volvo Cars have still managed to maintain their high class safety ratings in test results, even with the IIHS. The Volvo XC90, S80 and C70 all score top scores in these rated crash tests.
In 2008, a French court found Volvo guilty of causing the death of two children and serious injuries of one in Wasselonne on the 17th of June, 1999, when the brakes of a 1996 Volvo 850 failed. The court found Volvo partially responsible for the accident, and sentenced Volvo to a 200,000 Euro fine.

Current models Today, the company uses a system of letters denoting body style followed by the series number. S stands for saloon or sedan, C stands for coupé or convertible and V stands for versatile as in estate car. XC stands for cross country originally added to a more rugged V70 model as the V70XC and indicates all wheel drive paired with a raised suspension to give it a mock SUV look. Volvo would later change the name to the XC70 in order to maintain consistency with the XC90. So a V50 is an estate ("V") that is smaller than the V70.
Originally, Volvo was planning a different naming scheme. S and C were to be the same, but "F", standing for flexibility, was to be used on station wagons. When Volvo introduced the first generation S40 and V40 at Frankfurt in 1994, they were announced as the S4 and F4. However, Audi complained that it had inherent rights to the S4 name, since it names its sporty vehicles "S", and the yet-to-be-introduced sport version of the Audi A4 would have had the S4 name. Volvo agreed to add a second digit, so the vehicles became the S40 and F40. However, that led to a complaint from Ferrari, who used the Ferrari F40 name on their legendary sports car. This led to Volvo switching the "F" to "V", for versatile.
