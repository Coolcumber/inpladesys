HANDSEWING

When people think of sewing, many think of different things. In thebroadest sense, the term "Sewing" denotes the use of thread andneedle in a much wider range of activities and needle arts."Sewing" may be divided into two categories:
1. Hand Sewing Arts
2.Machine Sewing Arts.

H and Sewing Arts

Hand sewing arts are also described as needlework. They includeCrochet, Hand Embroidery, Knitting, Macrame', Rug Making, Tatting,Cross Stitch, and Hand Sewing. These arts have dominated sewing forthousands of years, and are considered to be traditional arts ofexcellence and beauty using threads and needles.

Crochet

Crochet is a needlework system of interlocking looped stitchesformed by a single hook and a single yarn for creating delicateopen designs. Crochet became popular almost four hundred years agoas a means to creating "American Lace". Today, crochet is atreasured heritage skill used for making items for home and familysuch as pot holders.

When you look at a Crochet pattern, it may look a bit intimidating.It is full of strange letter combinations that require you masterthe Crochet code or language. For example, you will seeabbreviations for beginning as beg; block as bl; and cluster as cl.Not only do you need to master the code, you have a whole set ofterms, definitions, intricate designs, and skill sets to learn. Itis indeed a highly skilled art form.

Actually doing crochet is a matter of using the hook or largeneedle to twist, wrap, insert, arrange, and otherwise hand loop asingle yarn to form a multitude of stitch patterns. Thecombinations form stitches described as half crochet, singlecrochet, double crochet, and treble crochet. The stitches arechained together in rows, joined, and expanded to form theinterlocking patterns. Different sized crochet hooks made ofvarious materials are also used for a variety of purposes. The endresult is an intricate design such as one of the afghan stitchpatterns (Basic, Cluster, Crossed Tunisian, Framed Squares, Mesh,Purl, etc.) There are hundreds of different patterns and variationsproducing truly amazing crochet art.

Hand Embroidery

Embroidery is a technique to embellish fabric using decorativethreads. Color, texture, and design become the artistic tools ofexpression with thread and needle. These techniques are commonlyapplied to borders, motifs, and elaborate designs on the face ofthe fabric. There are hundreds of different stitches used to createbeautiful effects. There are border stitches, design stitches, edgestitches, fill stitches, outline stitches, and more.

There are special tools and materials used in this art form. Theyinclude a collection of needles including the crewel needle (shortneedle with long skinny eye in sizes from 1 to 12. Lower number islargest needle.), chenille needle (sizes 13 to 26), and tapestryneedles (sizes 13 to 26). Embroidery frames are used to stabilizethe fabric while it is being worked on. These come in many sizesfrom small lap circles to large free standing square frames.Fabrics may range from simple open mesh canvas to elaboratetapestry. Embroidery scissors both large and small are essentialfor cutting yarns and threads. A stiletto may be used to makeeyelet holes. A thimble is essential for protecting the finger fromthe sharp end of the needle when pushing through the fabric. Yarnsand threads of all kinds are used to create amazing color, texture,and design.

Embroidery stitches may be classified by how they lay on a fabric.Flat stitches lay flat. Knotted stitches are more raised. Likedstitches offer an interlocking appearance. Looped stitches includethe blanket and feather stitches which offer a combination of flatand raised appearance. Hand embroidery stitches rival the mostadvanced sewing machines in complexity and number of differentstitches.

As sheer artwork, hand embroidery is often considered superior tothe more modern machine embroidery. There are designs and featuresof hand embroidery that can and will probably never be reproducedthrough machine embroidery. Although, machine embroidery is muchfaster, hand embroidery is like painting by hand with thread andyarn.

Hand Knitting

Hand knitting is very similar to crochet in that it is a needleworksystem of interlocking looped stitches formed by using two (insteadof one hook as in crochet) large knitting needles and a single yarnfor creating delicate open designs. It has been traced back toabout 200AD from the region of modern day Arabia. Theory has itthat Arabian travelers such as sailors, traders, and adventurerstook this special skill with them and taught it to people whereverthey traveled.

Knitting remains a popular fashion oriented needle art. Among themore common items made today include afghans, baby blankets,booties, and other novel heirloom items.

Like crochet, knitting has a special code of its own. When youbegin looking at a knitting pattern for the first time, it lookslike long lists of gibberish. The code might look something likethis: inc R for increase to the right; psso for pass or pullslipped stitch over; or wyib for yarn to back of work. It takessome time to figure out all the details of the code, and evenlonger to master the intricate skill sets to make the almostlimitless stitches and patterns.

Basically, the vast array of knitting stitches are variations oneither the basic knit stitch or the purl stitch. These variationsare applied in many different designs as well.

Knitting needles are available in both an American and a Britishsystem of identification. In the British system, they run fromeighteen down to eight (18, 17, 16,…13,… 8). From the Britishthirteen to the British eight you have equivalent American sizezero to ten and a half 0,1,2,3,…). There are also circular needles,double pointed straight needles, jumper needles, and single pointstraight needles.

Knitting yarn comes in a wide range of fibers (wool, cotton, silk,linen, synthetics), colors, textures, sizes, and twists. Each yarnoffers its own special uses and qualities. It is simplest, however,to simply follow the pattern for best results.

Macrame'

Macrame' is basically knot tying to produce fringe or coarse lacedesigned in a geometrical patterns. It has an uncertain origin, buthas been traced back to the Spain and France and even back toMiddle Eastern roots. A quick glance at macrame' and you may beconvinced that it is far too complicated to actually do or learn,but once the two basic knots are mastered, it is sometimesdescribed as the easiest of the needle arts. These two knots arethe square knot and the Half Hitch. The combination of these simpleknots quickly becomes an awe inspiring display with amazingresults.

The materials used for macrame' are quite simple: yarns, cord,rope, pins, measuring tape, pins, pinning board, rubber bands,glue, and crochet hook for occasional poking and twisting. Thisneedle art certainly reminds one of the exceptional knot tyingskills of sailors.

Rug Making

Rug making is an application needle art to a specific practicalemphasis: making floor coverings. This art form taps many differentskills and techniques including Braiding, Crochet, Embroidery,Hooking, Knitting, and Knotting. You are likely to have one ofthese art forms in your home right now. We have an embroidered rugin our family room. We also have a braided rug in our kitchen.

Fabric for rug making may be made by cutting long strips of fabric,tearing the strips, or purchasing the precut rolls of fabric. Thewidth of the fabric will in large part determine the size of yourhooking and knots. The narrower the fabric the smaller the hooking,and the wider the fabric gives you larger hooking.

Tatting

Tatting is needlework using shuttle and thread to make loops andknots to create gorgeous lace. My grandmother was an expert attatting. She would sit for hours creating the most delicate lacefor table coverings, lace collars, and all manner of other laceitems. I remember being awestruck at how complicated it all seemed.Later, I was assured that if you learn the basic stitch, everythingelse comes automatically.

Cross Stitch

Cross stitch is like embroidery in that it embellishes fabrics, butcross stitch uses special cloth called ida cloth with specificcount weave. This fabric allows the cross stitch artist to createdesigns, drawings, and images with cross stitch.

Cross Stitch has become highly popular for producing wall hangingswith wise sayings and interesting eye catching designs. Crossstitch may be seen framed much like an ordinary photo or in a hoopwhich serves as a homey touch.

While many attempts have been made to imitate cross stitch usingcomputer software, many people prefer the look and feel oftraditional hand stitching. I frequently hear comments like, I loveto cross stitch because I can relax in my rocker and stitch away,and when I am done everyone love my product.

Hand Sewing And Hand Quilting

Perhaps the most versatile needle art is hand sewing and handquilting. Not only does it offer highly practical applications, italso offers great beauty and decorative applications. Clothingconstruction and embellishment have long been a primary focus ofhand sewing. Home decorating, pillows, soft furniture covers,draperies, and other projects have also been popular applications.Quilting is also a part of sewing in which fabrics are joined,layered, and quilted (sewn together).

Hand sewing and hand quilting involve many special tools forcutting, layout, measuring, and stitching. Special hand sewingneedles are used for hundreds of different stitches and theirapplications. Scissors, snips, and seam rippers are vital tools.Tape measures and rulers make measuring easy. Quilters find thatquilt frames or wooden frames are useful for holding fabrics stableduring the quilting process.

All of these activities and traditional needle arts may bedescribed as handwork or Hand Sewing Arts.
MACHINESEWING

Sewing Machine Clothing Construction

Clothing Construction is the grandmother of all sewings, andincludes use of hundreds of different stitches and techniques. Thesewing machine is used to sew seams, hems, staystitching,understitching, and decorative applications.

Once clothing construction was considered an absolute necessity,but today it is part of the best hobby in the world. Yes, you cansave money. Now you can make your own clothes so they truly fit andlook good on you. Instead of paying a thousand dollars for a dress,you can make it for a couple hundred.

The personal touch is yours to make. You can purchase ready madeclothing which often do not fit, and make the alterations forperfect fit. You could have it altered at seventy five to a hundreddollars, or do it yourself for free. Imagine buying a hundreddollar suit with a missing button, or poor fit for just a fewdollars on clearance. You can quickly and easily turn that rejectinto a treasured suit. You can do it.

How to make aquilt


The design you pick will guide you in selecting theright fabrics, patterns, tools, and other materials needed for yourquilt.

These three must work together: design, fabric, andpattern. A great design can be ruined by choosing the wrong fabricor pattern.

So how do you choose?

1. Imagine the finished product first. Try to seethrough your mind's eye, what your quilt will look like when it isdone. Dream a little.

2. You might use one of the many software programsavailable to help bring practical definition to your project. Usethe program to draw out your ideas. You can arrange, group, andsort quickly and easily.

3. If you don't have software, try using pencil andpaper. Draw out your thoughts. Do whatever it takes to define yourfinished project.

4. You may prefer using certain techniques or tools.Consider how these might affect the construction of your quilt. Youhave many options including paper piecing, patterns, and stencils.If you prefer a specific quilting process, use it to layout thedesign of your quilt.

5. A beginning quilter often, learns one way ofdoing things, and practices that approach on several quilts beforeattempting new and different approaches. Keep in mind quiltingshould be fun, so avoid stressing out over having to master wholenew sets of skills on each new quilt project.

6. When you use small pieces to create a block, itis called piecing. While there are several different ways to dothis, one of the first thing quilters learn is to use thetraditional 1/4" seam allowance. This will affect how you cut outyour fabrics, how you lay them out, and how they go together.

7. You may choose to embellish you quilt blocks withappliqu embroidery, or stenciled designs.

8. When you use a block design approach, eventuallyyou have to join the blocks together. Before joining them, however,it is essential that you square your quilt blocks to insure thatthey are all exactly same size, shape, and uniform. Then you maycomplete the assembly.This again may be done in several ways, butBlock to Block and using borders are the most common.

Once you complete all your blocks,and you have assembled them together, we say that the quilt top isfinished. There are still some big steps before we can say thequilt is do ne.

BATTING: The next step is toselect the backing material and the batting or fill material foryour quilt. There are different types of batting including allcotton, all polyester, and blends of polyester and cotton. Ask youlocal quilt shop or teacher, about what batting they recommend foryour project. You may prefer one type over another or you maydecide based on your current project. All you have to do is openthe bag and unroll it. This type of batting comes in differentlofts or thicknesses, the thicker the loft, the warmer thequilt.

BACKING: Color, texture, and fabric content are considerations whenchoosing the backing fabric. Generally, the backing fabric is notas important as the quilt top, so you may get by with a little lessquality fabric or even a lower thread count fabric. Generally, youwant a woven fabric because you want it keep its shape instead ofstretching. There are larger width fabrics, but in many cases youwill need to seam the backing fabric together to make it just alittle larger (2" all the way around) than the top. Before usingbacking there are a few things you will need to do. First, trim offthe selvage edge. Then preshrink the fabric to prevent shrinkageafter the quilt is finished. Finally sew three lengths of thefabric (equal widths) the length of the backing. Finally, press theseams to one side.

ASSEMBLY: Lay the backing down on the floor with its wrong side upand right side down. Roll out the batting smoothly over the backingfabric. Trim the batting about one inch shorter than the backingfabric and one inch longer than the quilt top. Center the quilt topon top of the batting face-up.

BASTING: The three layers of thequilt are now ready to assemble. Before attempting to finish sew,however, the layers must be temporarily fastened together. This maybe done by simply pinning the three layers together. Sewing with along straight stitch will Baste the layers together. Begin in thecenter of the quilt. You may use running stitches or Z stitches forbasting.

MACHINE QUILTING: You are nowready to quilt the finished project. The most common way to achievethis is by machine quilting. With smaller projects, this can beaccomplished with a standard sewing machine, but with largerprojects some type of machine quilting frame is required. The newGrace Quilter does a great job for the home, but there are manyquilt frames available. The quilt is rolled onto a frame and sewntogether according to specialized templates or by using one of thefollowing techniques.

STITCH IN DITCH: A common practiceis to use the sewing technique of stitching in the ditch, or sewingright into the seam itself. With a little practice, the threadalmost disappears.

ECHO DESIGN: You may decide to useEcho Design which is stitching along the outline of the blockrepeating lines of stitches every quarter inch to createrepetitious sections of very heavy quilting.

OVERALL QUILTING: You may chooseto use an overall quilting design using square grids, diamondshapes, or clamshells. This approach does not follow the outline ofthe block but ignores it.

HAND QUILTING: Hand quilting will require quilt frame, or a largehoop. Hoops are more portable, but require more basting. Once yourproject is secure you begin stitching the three layers together invery small uniform stitches, using the design you chose earlier.Start With about 18 inches of thread and begin working in thecentre of your project, quilting toward the outsideedge.

TYING: Hand quilting is oftenviewed even by hand sewers to be excessively meticulous. Analternative is typing the quilt together ever four inches or sewusing a think twine.

BINDING: Now that the quilt isquilted, all that remains is to finish the edge. Double check thesquare o f the quilt before beginning andadjust as needed. Then bind the edges by using bias strips offabric or pre-cut bias tape sewn on one side, folded over and sewnon the other.

The Straight Stitch

The straight stitch may be adjusted for stitchlength to create fine, medium, and long straight stitches. Thelongest straight stitch is called a basting stitch. When you addwidth to the straight stitch, you create the zig zag stitch. Longzig zag stitches form zig zag basting stitches. When the zig zagstitch is shortened very short so that the threads lie flat againsteach other, it forms a satin stitch.

To sew a satin stitch, it is essential to use a satin stitchpresser foot. The standard zig zag stitch presser foot has a ridgethat catch on threads if the threads begin to bunch up. The satinstitch presser foot has a groove on the bottom of the foot topermit the stitches to neatly flow under the presser foot withoutbecoming bunched up or snagged by the presser foot.

Adjust the satin stitch by adjusting the stitch length.

Adjust the stitches to a fine satin layer ofthreads. If the stitch length is too tight, the fabric may not moveat all or the threads may overlap leaving a lumpy lookingstitch.

If the stitch length is too long, you will seespaced between the treads. The goal is for the threads to line upneatly side by side forming a satin line of stitches.

Guide the fabric for all stitches in the same way. Place the fabricabout one half inch under the presser foot.

Place your guide hand (right hand) along the edge ofthe fabric in order to guide the fabric accurately.

Place or smoothing hand (left hand) on the top ofthe fabric to the left and in front of the needle to keep thefabric lying flat and flowing smoothly.

Allow the sewing machine to drivethe fabric through the machine.

When sewing curves with a satin stitch, remembernot to turn too sharply. A gradual run will keep the satin stitchfrom leaving spaced between the threads. It may be necessary toslightly shorten the stitch length if you are find too many openspaces between threads along curves. SEWING A ROLLEDHEM

A rolled hem is a hem created by use of a specialrolled hem presser foot on a serger or sewing machine. You feed thefabric through the guide in the foot. The foot actually rolls thefabric over in preparation for sewing. As the fabric is fed throughthe rolled hem foot it is top stitched in place creating a verynarrow hem that can be used on dozens of different projects: tablecloths, scarves, garments, linings, ruffles, etc. The finished hemwill be between one and six millimeters wide depending on the sizeof the specialized presser foot and the thickness of thefabric.


Follow these simple guidelines toperfect rolled hems.

1. You must have a good sewing machine (orserger) and its rolled hem foot.

2. Prepare your sewing by cleaning the work areamaking it free of debris and anything that might snag the fabricwhile you sew. Clean away any lint from the bobbin area, and makesure the machine is properly threaded.

3. Install the Rolled Hem Presser Foot. Differentbrands and models offer different sized rolled hem feet. You mayactually have only one or two or three different sizes that fityour machine. If you have more than one size select the one bestsuited to your project. If for any reason you do not have a rolledhem foot, you may purchase a generic one. Take one of your regularfeet with you so your sewing specialist can match your machineappropriately. When you examine the rolled hem foot you will noticea turned piece of metal that looks like a scroll. This actuallyhelps turn the fabric in preparation for sewing. Under the presserfoot, you will notice a groove that allows the rolled hem to easilypass under the presser foot after it is sewn.

4. Select a straight stitch appropriate forRolled Hem Presser Foot. Note: many machines allow you to sew astraight stitch in multiple positions (left, center, right, inbetween). Make certain that your machine stitch is lined upproperly with the needle hole in the Rolled Hem Presser Foot. Anarrow zig zag setting may also be used if desired, but make surethat it fits your presser foot.

5. Normal tension settings are recommended unlessyou have recently changed the size of the thread you are using forthe project. If you are changing the size of thread, you will needto adjust accordingly. Larger thread means decreasing tensions alittle. Smaller thread means increase tension settings a little.After your sew your test seam, you may need to readjust yourtensions for perfect stitch balance.

6. Match Needle and Thread to the project. Sincemost rolled hems are sewn on delicate to medium weight fabrics, youwill likely use a size 8 (delicate) to a size 12 (medium heavy)needle. The thread may be a fine long fiber polyester embroiderytype thread or a natural thread matched to the fabric type. Forsuper delicate fabrics use size 60 threads, and for medium fabricsuse size 50 threads.

7. Adjust the stitch length to medium fordelicate fabric and a bit longer for medium weight fabrics. On yoursewing machine, your stitch length adjusting knob will havesettings ranging from 0 Fine to 4 or more. The larger the numberthe longer the stitch and fewer stitches per inch.

Setting is the adjustment on your stitchselector.
MM stands for Millimeters on the MetricScale.
SPI stands for Stitches Per Inch.

8. ALWAYS TEST FIRST. You may be an expert, andthinking to yourself, "I already know how to do all of this." Butone mistake can ruin a whole project, unless your are careful todouble check "all is well" first. To Test follow steps 9-20 on apiece of scrap fabric of the same type as you are using in yourproject. If you have problems, during the test, fix beforeproceeding. It will save lots of heartache later. When your test isjust right, proceed to use your project fabric and complete steps 9and following.

9. Trim the edge to be hemmed. Remove any looseand especially any already frayed threads from the edge of thepiece. Whenever possible align the fabric to be edge along itslengthwise grain. This will make a better hem than on cross grainor bias of the fabric.

10. Lay the fabric for hemming right side down(wrong side up). Position the fabric so the insertion will be tothe right and the bulk of the fabric lies to your left.

11. Prepare the fabric for insertion into thepresser foot. Your goal is to produce the smallest possible hem.Tightly fold over the edge of the fabric two times. Make thefinished fold the same size as the guide on the presser foot. Youmay use a pin to hold the fold in place, or proceed withoutpinning.

12. Using your right hand, roll the hand wheeltoward you until the needle is at its highest position.

13. With the folded fabric held tightly, lift thepresser foot and slide the folded fabric under it. Lower thepresser foot to hold the fabric in place.

14. Roll the hand wheel forward some more untilthe needle penetrates the fabric to hold it in place.

15. Lift the presser foot, and remove any pinsyou may have near the presser foot. Slide the folded fabric intothe shaped scroll guide of the foot.

16. Lower the presser foot and prepare tosew.

17. Take thread trails in your left hand and holdthem to the left and behind the needle to prevent their messing upyour hem.

18. Take hold the edge of the fabric rolling thefabric over your thumb. Gently, feed and guide it through therolled hem presser foot scroll guide as you sew.

SewingTips

When teaching children to hand sew - it IS helpfulto use safety pins and place them all on the same side. This way asyou instruct them in sewing, if they always keep the pins facingthe ceiling, the piece won't get all twisted and the thread won'tget knotted as often.

When hand sewing - if the thread (or yarn) becomestwisted just drop the needle while holding onto what you are sewingand it will unwind itself.

When kids want to learn to sew with a needle andthread - Felt is the perfect fabric to start with as the edgesdon't fray and the needle glides through easily.

When threading ribbon or elastic thru a casing -attach a safety pin to one end (be sure to close the safety pin).The pin will be easier to push through the casing.

When sewing with a sewing machine - to make a knot,take 3 - 4 forward stitches then go backward 3 - 4 stitches andstart stitching forward again. This will secure your thread so itdoesn't come undone.
